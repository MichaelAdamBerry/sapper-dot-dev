    Hi! I'm a self taught developer and problem solver bringing a fresh
    perspective to web development and creating experiences on the web.
  </p>

  <p>
    I'm interested in exploring new possibilities with HTML, Javascript, and
    CSS. I primarily specialize in client side code, but also happy to roll up
    my sleeves and dig into the server side as well.
  </p>

  <p>
    Before learning to code, I had a wide range of work experiences having
    worked previously as an actor, carpenter, and project manager for live
    events. As an actor I appeared in films and plays in New York and regionally
    across the US. You can check out my
    <a href="https://www.imdb.com/find?s=all&q=adam+barrie">IMDB page</a>
    if you want to see some of the films I appeared in which many critics hailed
    as "just fine".
  </p>

  <!-- <p>
    Here are some of the tools, frameworks, and libraries I reach for most often
    when creating new projects:

  <p>So you two dig up, dig up dinosaurs? What do they got in there? King Kong? My dad once told me, laugh and the world laughs with you, Cry, and I'll give you something to cry about you little bastard! Life finds a way. God creates dinosaurs. God destroys dinosaurs. God creates Man. Man destroys God. Man creates Dinosaurs.</p>
  <p>You really think you can fly that thing? You know what? It is beets. I've crashed into a beet truck. Forget the fat lady! You're obsessed with the fat lady! Drive us out of here! Is this my espresso machine? Wh-what is-h-how did you get my espresso machine?</p>
  <p>Hey, you know how I'm, like, always trying to save the planet? Here's my chance. Hey, take a look at the earthlings. Goodbye! I was part of something special. Just my luck, no ice. You're a very talented young man, with your own clever thoughts and ideas. Do you need a manager?</p>
  <p>Jaguar shark! So tell me - does it really exist? This thing comes fully loaded. AM/FM radio, reclining bucket seats, and... power windows. Yes, Yes, without the oops! You're a very talented young man, with your own clever thoughts and ideas. Do you need a manager?</p>
  <p>Yes, Yes, without the oops! Do you have any idea how long it takes those cups to decompose. They're using our own satellites against us. And the clock is ticking. Do you have any idea how long it takes those cups to decompose. My dad once told me, laugh and the world laughs with you, Cry, and I'll give you something to cry about you little bastard!</p> -->
